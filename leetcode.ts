/*2733. Neither Minimum nor Maximum (Easy)
Given an integer array nums containing distinct positive integers, find and
return any number from the array that is neither the minimum nor the maximum
value in the array, or -1 if there is no such number. Return the selected
integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value
             is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum
             nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the
             given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 2 is neither the maximum nor the minimum value in nums,
             it is the only valid answer.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
* All values in nums are distinct*/

function findNonMinOrMax(nums: number[]): number {
    if (nums.length < 3) return -1;
    return nums.slice(0, 3).sort((a, b) => (a-b))[1];
};


/*2744. Find Maximum Number of String Pairs (Easy)
You are given a 0-indexed array words consisting of distinct strings. The
string words[i] can be paired with the string words[j] if:
* The string words[i] is equal to the reversed string of words[j].
* 0 <= i < j < words.length.
Return the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the array words.
Note that each string can belong in at most one pair.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following
             way:
             - We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed
               string of word[0] is "dc" and is equal to words[2].
             - We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed
               string of word[1] is "ca" and is equal to words[3].
             It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can
             be formed.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["ab","ba","cc"]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we can form 1 pair of strings in the following
             way:
             - We pair the 0th string with the 1st string, as the reversed
               string of words[1] is "ab" and is equal to words[0].
             It can be proven that 1 is the maximum number of pairs that can
             be formed.

Example 3:
Input: words = ["aa","ab"]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, we are unable to form any pair of strings.

Constraints:
* 1 <= words.length <= 50
* words[i].length == 2
* words consists of distinct strings.
* words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.*/

function maximumNumberOfStringPairs(words: string[]): number {
    let ans = 0, seen = new Set();

/*2824. Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target (Easy)
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer target,
return the number of pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n and
nums[i] + nums[j] < target.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,1,2,3,1], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in the
             statement:
             - (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = 0 < target
             - (0, 2) since 0 < 2 and nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 < target
             - (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = 0 < target
             Note that (0, 3) is not counted since nums[0] + nums[3] is not
             strictly less than the target.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-6,2,5,-2,-7,-1,3], target = -2
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 10 pairs of indices that satisfy the conditions in
             the statement:
             - (0, 3) since 0 < 3 and nums[0] + nums[3] = -8 < target
             - (0, 1) since 0 < 1 and nums[0] + nums[1] = -4 < target
             - (0, 4) since 0 < 4 and nums[0] + nums[4] = -13 < target
             - (0, 5) since 0 < 5 and nums[0] + nums[5] = -7 < target
             - (0, 6) since 0 < 6 and nums[0] + nums[6] = -3 < target
             - (1, 4) since 1 < 4 and nums[1] + nums[4] = -5 < target
             - (3, 4) since 3 < 4 and nums[3] + nums[4] = -9 < target
             - (3, 5) since 3 < 5 and nums[3] + nums[5] = -3 < target
             - (4, 5) since 4 < 5 and nums[4] + nums[5] = -8 < target
             - (4, 6) since 4 < 6 and nums[4] + nums[6] = -4 < target

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length == n <= 50
* -50 <= nums[i], target <= 50*/

/*2828. Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words (Easy)
Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym
of words. The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed
by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For
example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed
from ["bear", "aardvark"]. Return true if s is an acronym of words, and
false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie"
             are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the
             acronym.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["an","apple"], s = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: The first character in the words "an" and "apple" are 'a' and
             'a', respectively. The acronym formed by concatenating these
             characters is "aa". Hence, s = "a" is not the acronym.

Example 3:
Input: words = ["never","gonna","give","up","on","you"], s = "ngguoy"
Output: true
Explanation: By concatenating the first character of the words in the array,
             we get the string "ngguoy". Hence, s = "ngguoy" is the acronym.

Constraints:
* 1 <= words.length <= 100
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
* 1 <= s.length <= 100
* words[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters.*/

function isAcronym(words: string[], s: string): boolean {
    return words.length === s.length && words.every((v, i) => v[0] === s[i]);
};


/*2855. Minimum Right Shifts to Sort the Array (Easy)
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n containing distinct
positive integers. Return the minimum number of right shifts required to
sort nums and -1 if this is not possible. A right shift is defined as
shifting the element at index i to index (i + 1) % n, for all indices.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: After the first right shift, nums = [2,3,4,5,1]. After the
             second right shift, nums = [1,2,3,4,5]. Now nums is sorted;
             therefore the answer is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums is already sorted therefore, the answer is 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: It's impossible to sort the array using right shifts.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums contains distinct integers.*/

function minimumRightShifts(nums: number[]): number {
    let k = 0, n = nums.length;

            if (k) return -1;
            k = i;
        }
    if (k === 0) return 0;

/*2913. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares I (Easy)
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. The distinct count of a
subarray of nums is defined as:
* Let nums[i..j] be a subarray of nums consisting of all the indices from i
  to j such that 0 <= i <= j < nums.length. Then the number of distinct
  values in nums[i..j] is called the distinct count of nums[i..j].
Return the sum of the squares of distinct counts of all subarrays of nums. A
subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: 15
Explanation: Six possible subarrays are:
             [1]: 1 distinct value
             [2]: 1 distinct value
             [1]: 1 distinct value
             [1,2]: 2 distinct values
             [2,1]: 2 distinct values
             [1,2,1]: 2 distinct values
             The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays
             is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 + 22 + 22 + 22 = 15.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three possible subarrays are:
             [1]: 1 distinct value
             [1]: 1 distinct value
             [1,1]: 1 distinct value
             The sum of the squares of the distinct counts in all subarrays
             is equal to 12 + 12 + 12 = 3.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 100*/

function sumCounts(nums: number[]): number {
    let ans = 0;
    for (let i = 0, n = nums.length; i < n; ++i) {
        const seen = new Set();
        for (let j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            seen.add(nums[j]);

/*2917. Find the K-or of an Array (Easy)
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and an integer k. The K-or of
nums is a non-negative integer that satisfies the following:
* The ith bit is set in the K-or if and only if there are at least k
  elements of nums in which bit i is set.
Return the K-or of nums. Note that a bit i is set in x if (2i AND x) == 2i,
where AND is the bitwise AND operator.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15], k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: Bit 0 is set at nums[0], nums[2], nums[4], and nums[5].
             Bit 1 is set at nums[0], and nums[5].
             Bit 2 is set at nums[0], nums[1], and nums[5].
             Bit 3 is set at nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], and nums[5].
             Only bits 0 and 3 are set in at least k elements of the array,
             and bits i >= 4 are not set in any of the array's elements.
             Hence, the answer is 2^0 + 2^3 = 9.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,12,1,11,4,5], k = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Since k == 6 == nums.length, the 6-or of the array is equal to
             the bitwise AND of all its elements. Hence, the answer is 2 AND
             12 AND 1 AND 11 AND 4 AND 5 = 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [10,8,5,9,11,6,8], k = 1
Output: 15
Explanation: Since k == 1, the 1-or of the array is equal to the bitwise OR
             of all its elements. Hence, the answer is
             10 OR 8 OR 5 OR 9 OR 11 OR 6 OR 8 = 15.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 50
* 0 <= nums[i] < 231
* 1 <= k <= nums.length*/

/*2932. Maximum Strong Pair XOR I (Easy)
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of integers x and y is
called a strong pair if it satisfies the condition:
* |x - y| <= min(x, y)
You need to select two integers from nums such that they form a strong pair
and their bitwise XOR is the maximum among all strong pairs in the array.
Return the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array
nums. Note that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 11 strong pairs in the array nums: (1, 1), (1, 2),
             (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5)
             and (5, 5). The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is
             3 XOR 4 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,100]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 2 strong pairs in the array nums: (10, 10) and
             (100, 100). The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is
             10 XOR 10 = 0 since the pair (100, 100) also gives
             100 XOR 100 = 0.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,6,25,30]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 6 strong pairs in the array nums: (5, 5), (5, 6),
             (6, 6), (25, 25), (25, 30) and (30, 30). The maximum XOR
             possible from these pairs is 25 XOR 30 = 7 since the only other
             non-zero XOR value is 5 XOR 6 = 3.

Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 50
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 100*/
